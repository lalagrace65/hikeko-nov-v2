            <GiTrail className="mr-2 width-5   text-green-600" />
            2. Stick to the trail. Do not enter grass fields or trample on wild flowers.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="paragraph" className="flex items-center">
            <FaTree className="mr-2 width-5   text-green-600" />

            <MdVolumeOff className="mr-2 width-5   text-green-600" />

            <FaCampground className="mr-2 width-5   text-green-600" />

            <FaDog className="mr-2   text-green-600" />
            10. Fishing and hunting are not allowed. Pets are not permitted during the climb; you may leave them at the barangay hall for a small fee.

          <Typography variant="paragraph" className="flex items-center">
            <FaRecycle className="mr-2  text-green-600" />
            11. Practice Leave No Trace (LNT): Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, kill nothing but time.
